# Mistral
This repository includes a pytorch implementation of Mistral models (Base + Mixture Of Experts). The dataset used in the 
training of the model is based on dialogues from a play. The model is a miniature version of the actual Mistral due to 
infrastructure constraints.

## Mistral Base

* Epochs = 30
* Batch Size = 32
* Max Seq Len = 512
* Window Size = 128
* Dim = 128
* Decoder Blocks = 2
* Total Heads = 8
* Total KV Heads = 2
* Vocab Size = 32001

### Training Dataset
The training dataset is same as the one present inside the Llama2 folder. Check the file named **input.txt**.
